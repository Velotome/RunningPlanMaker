# RunningPlanMaker

## Short description

I noticed that most people are using sheets to make a training plan and often run into problems when things do not go as planned and they need to change things. This app solves this problem by allowing the user to regenerate the plan easily according to his needs. The program will also offer preconfigure plans but experienced runners should be able to configure most of the plan themselves.
Finally, the plan will give more detailed workout in the near future. Right now I used it only to generate the distances according to the 80/20 rule and the 10% increase in volume per week. I personnaly use the plan generated to train for my first 100km ultramarathon and thus based myself on the advices from more experienced runners such as Simon from https://www.youtube.com/@runningwithsimon

Disclaimer : While I strived to make the best plan possible, I'm not a trained professional when it comes to sport science so I don't claim any responsability for potential injuries and I welcome the user to adjust said plan to there feelings

## Upcoming features

- UI (in progress)
- Fully configurable plan generation
- Detailed workout generation with multiple kind of workout to choose from
- MAYBE cherry pick and customized individual workout from the app but might be too tedious to use. Since we do not auto log the workouts, I think letting the user do as he/she wants is better
